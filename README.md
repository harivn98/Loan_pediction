Loan prediction using K-means clustering involves grouping loan applicants into clusters based on similar characteristics to predict the likelihood of loan defaults. The process starts with data collection and preprocessing, which includes gathering relevant data, cleaning it, and normalizing features. Next, key features influencing loan repayment are selected. The K-means algorithm is then applied to determine an optimal number of clusters and partition the data accordingly. Each cluster is analyzed to identify common traits, and clusters are labeled based on risk levels. New applicants are assigned to these clusters, and their default probability is predicted based on the cluster's characteristics. Finally, the model is evaluated and adjusted to improve accuracy. This approach helps lenders understand the risk profile of different applicant groups and make more informed loan approval decisions.
